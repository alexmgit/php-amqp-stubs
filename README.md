php-amqp-stubs
==============

Stubs of php-amqp (pdezwart/php-amqp) via packagist

If you need stubs for unit-test your php-amqp setup in an environment without working php-amqp extension (e.g. your desktop), just add "empi89/php-amqp-stubs": "dev-master" to your composer.json. 

In production env the autoloader will not load this classes as the classes are already loaded by the extension.
